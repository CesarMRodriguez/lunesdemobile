#Session 1

In this folder we have the following content:

* test application developed in Android Studio: This application is different from the one used in the Stream. We have two Fragments. The first one with the Java code that sniffs http traffic. 

The second one has an empty Load button you can use to implement your own script and practice Frida.  You also have a hook in the onViewCreated in order to add extra content without the need to override the whole method, you can ignore it as well.

* hpandro.apk: This application is the one used to execute all the tests.
 
* http_task.js: First attempt to sniff http traffic with Frida. As a homework you can try to modify the script in order to work :)

* http_task2.js: Second attempt to sniff http traffic with Frida.
